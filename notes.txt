(root) means it will organise and help in creating folders without affecting the url
eg: to call the about folder i do not want to call /roots/about
i can simpley call /about.

tecnique best for server side rendering
static rendering strategy(ssg) not good for constent update required website 

incremental static regneration(isr)
-> time based re-validation 
-> revalidate the request after some time 
difference: first uses revalidate = 3600 all will be done
second only some part will be revalidate

server side rendering(ssr)
-> revalidate when user needs like amazon here revalidation = 0
when user wants the revalidation will be done

partial pre rendering(ppr)
-> hybrid aproach (statics and dynamic)
-> allows to render staic while streming dynamic
